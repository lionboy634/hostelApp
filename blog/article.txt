<The newly elected vice chancellor is a reputable and hardworking lady who for many years has immnesely contributed to
 the development of the nation.Her research has changed a lot in the world of science. She was elected not on any bias
  basis.She is the first female vice chancellor in the history of the country. The vice chancellor work is a tedious job 
  and the school has placed all their hope and belief in her that she can do it. We the students are hoping that under her leadership
there will be some enormous changes in the developments around campus. Her inauguration as a vice chancellor has somehow 
given hope to the females on campus who for some reasons didnt believe that they could achieve such achievements. What a 
nice way to start this semester? This is a step towards immense devlopment around and on campus. 
 There are numerous things the school lacks. We hope our cry will be heards
