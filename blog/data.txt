She is the first female vice chancellor in the history of the country. The vice chancellor work is a tedious job and 
the school has placed all their hope and belief in her that she can do it. We the students are hoping that under her
leadership
there will be some enormous changes in the developments around campus.  
Her inauguration as a vice chancellor has somehow given hope to the females on campus who for some reasons didnt believe that they could achieve such achievements. What a nice way to start this semester? This is a step towards immense devlopment around and on campus. 
 There are numerous things the school lacks. We hope our cry will be heard .She has gathered the best team to help her achieve
 the promises she made us. We, KNUST students, are hoping for a change and we believe Vice chancellor Rita Akosua Dickson can 
 give it to us
